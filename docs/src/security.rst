Galileo Security Overview
=========================
All use of the Galileo service must comply with our 
`terms of service <https://hypernetlabs.io/terms-of-service/>`_ and 
`privacy policy <https://hypernetlabs.io/privacy-policy/>`_.

Self-Hosting vs Default Hosting
-------------------------------
Galileo is a Platform-as-a-Service offering, and as such it allows the 
end user to host certain components of the platform on their own self-administered 
resources. Currently users can choose to host their own object storage and their own 
compute resources or to use the default storage and compute resources provided by 
Galileo. All authentication flows are handled via `Auth0 <https://auth0.com/>`_. 

Storage
~~~~~~~
The default storage provider used by Galileo for Mission input files and job 
results is GCP Storage (standard level). More info on the security profile of 
GCP Storage can be found `here <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes#standard>`_. 
Users can choose to store input and result files on their own self-administered 
object storage, via the Cargo Bays feature, if they choose to do so and if Galileo 
already supports that particular storage technology. In this bring-your-own-storage 
scenario, the storage administrator has full control over the access and 
persistence of the files consumed and generated by the Galileo platform for 
the Galileo accounts targeting that resource as the storage destination. The 
Galileo web service requires a user-provided API key to access non-default object 
storage. These keys are stored in an encrypted format; access can be revoked by deleting
the associated Cargo Bay which removes the authentication credentials. 

Compute
~~~~~~~
Users of Galileo can host their own computational resources (virtual machines, 
HPC, etc.) by running their own instances of the Landing Zone daemon process 
and authenticating it against their Galileo account. When a user runs their 
own LZ, they assume total control of the underlying host machine and any jobs 
sent to the LZ via the Galileo web service (for more info, see Access Control). 
The LZ daemon is written in Python and the source code can be obtained and 
audited for security analysis purposes. 

Alternatively, users can run on the default compute resources provided in the 
communal Stations (the Linux and Windows Stations), or they can purchase privately
provisioned LZ instances. Users are given access to complimentary default 
computational resources when their account is created. Be aware that the default 
computational resources run simultaneous workloads from multiple Galileo users in 
containerized virtual environments. Provisioned Landing Zones, however, are private 
to the user who purchased them. All instances are sourced from 
`GCP <https://cloud.google.com/security/privacy/>`_ Compute Engine, 
`AWS <https://cloud.google.com/security/privacy/>`_ EC2, and 
`Azure <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/>`_ Virtual Machines. 

The LZ daemon communicates with the Galileo web service via TLS and HTTPS. The LZ 
daemon must be run with sufficient permissions so as to create containers with the 
targeted container runtime or scheduling environment (i.e. Docker, Singularity, 
Slurm, etc.). Reauthetication is fascilitated by writing a local authentication 
token file (provided by Auth0). Deleting the authentication token file will require 
the user to log their LZ daemon back into their account the next time it is restarted.  

Access Control
--------------
The Galileo platform has two primary features in which role-based access control is 
available: “Missions” and “Stations.” 

Missions
~~~~~~~~
Missions are reusable code/simulation buckets where a Galileo user can upload data 
files in the form of input files, scripts, binaries, etc. Importantly, a Galileo 
Mission can be set up as a pre-configured framework “type.” For example, a Galileo 
Mission can be configured as a Python project, an R project, or a Gromacs project. 
If a user sets up a Mission as one of the pre-supported framework types, then they 
do not have to supply their own Dockerfile as Galileo will produce this for them 
server-side. If a user does provide their own Dockerfile, Galileo identifies this 
Mission type as “user-defined.” 

Within the context of a Mission, Galileo users can invite collaborators as role-based 
members. The role assigned to a member determines if they read access to the input 
data and results data and if they have write/execute permission.

Stations
~~~~~~~~
Stations allow computational resources running the Galileo “Landing Zone” daemon to 
be shared with an arbitrary number of other Galileo users. Within the context of a 
Station, administrators can set:


* Which users are in the Station
* Number of available Landing Zones
* What Mission framework types are allowed to run (thus determining which base images are allowed to be pulled to the host machines)
* Resource usage defaults, such as max CPU and memory on a per-job and per-user basis
* Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly usage quotas 
* Custom user roles with associated role capabilities and resource/quota limits

User permissions are controlled via a role-based permission scheme. Custom roles can be created by administrators through the Station settings UI. The Station owner and administrators can control if a particular user role can:

* Add/remove Landing Zones
* Control the state of running or queued jobs within the Station context
* Invite member to and remove members from the Station
* Edit/assign role types
* Edit the default per-job and per-user max resource usage
* Edit the per-user max runtime quota
* Control which framework types are allowed to run within a Station context
* Run interactive Mission types
